                    <p>William Hanna joined a California engineering firm after studying engineering and journalism. He
                        switched careers to cartooning in 1930 and in 1937 joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a director and
                        story man in the animation department. Joseph Barbera was working as a bank accountant with the
                        Irving Trust Company in New York City during the early 1930s when he started submitting cartoons
                        to magazines; he sold his first to Collier’s magazine and decided to forsake banking for
                        cartooning. He joined MGM as a sketch artist in the same year as Hanna.</p>

                    <p>At MGM, Hanna and Barbera created the Tom and Jerry characters and produced more than 200 films
                        in the series between 1940 and 1957. They won seven Oscars from the Academy of Motion Picture
                        Arts and Sciences for their cartoons between 1943 and 1952. After 1957, when they formed their
                        own company, they made a prodigious number of cartoon series for television. They were derided
                        for employing cut-rate, limited animation techniques, which allowed for the timely production of
                        television cartoons, but they were praised for the quality of writing found in their most
                        successful productions, including Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, The Flintstones, and The
                        Jetsons. Their production company also produced the highly popular Scooby-Doo animated cartoon
                        series.</p>

            Hanna Barbera was a huge part of my childhood. Hanna Barbera was founded in 1957. It went defunct in 2001 but in their career, they put out some quality cartoons. I watched them either Saturday morning before my chores or after school before homework. I usually did some of my work during the Jetsons. I am probably showing my age with this article. However, I still watch cartoons. Not just “adult animation” like Family Guy or American Dad though those are definitely interesting. Here is my list of favorites.Scooby-Doo is the best. I remember him. He is my favorite cartoon of all time! I wasn’t alive for the original airings though I did get to see them in reruns. I have watched every one of the cartoon series though some not for very long. I really hate the last few incarnations of the gang. I also don’t like the recent cartoon style. Matthew Lillard is not voicing Shaggy in the new Scooby-Doo movie Scoob and I am upset.Captain Caveman was awesome. Or maybe it was screaming Caaaaaaaaaaaaptain Caaaaaaaaaaavemaaan! That was so attractive about the cartoon. My brother and I drove our parents nuts with that.
